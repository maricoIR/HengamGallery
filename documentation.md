the Items in Products page , the width and height and design of them is different from Home page
carousel cards but they should look as same as the Home carousel cards

sliding does not work , it should atleast have 4 products all the time and in mobile , the bottom
part of the Cards in that carousel is cutted off and not visible

been cleared and I can't see the selected Items
